## Summary of the Analysis 

The goal of this analysis is to create a report for an investment bank interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to their customers. This report will include the specific type of cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they can be properly grouped together. The data provided by CryptoCompare will be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, unsupervised learning will be performed to process data, cluster dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA on the given data.
